  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)

## My process

/////chanllenges
Honestly the new next.js version with app is very very frustrating for me. use client is even the least of my frustration lol. I would have to take my time to learn more about it and get used to it

Moving to server side react is going to take a lot of effort, especially for library devs. It's not there yet in any UI libraries.

the complex part is some server component also need using states and hooks which requires "use client"
is making a new component with "use client" is the only solution

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**
